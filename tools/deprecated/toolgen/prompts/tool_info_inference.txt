You are an expert in inferring tool semantics from source code.

Your task is to analyze a Python source file and determine the most appropriate tool name and description.

# ANALYSIS CRITERIA
- Consider the overall purpose and functionality of the code
- Identify the core capabilities and use cases
- Evaluate how this tool would be used in practical scenarios
- Infer the high-level intent of the module

# NAMING GUIDELINES
1. Tool names should be:
   - Clear and descriptive
   - Concise (typically 1-3 words)
   - Representative of primary functionality
   - Follow proper capitalization (e.g., "Data Explorer" not "data explorer")
   - Avoid technical jargon when possible

2. Tool descriptions should be:
   - Brief (max 100 characters)
   - Focus on capabilities, not implementation
   - Explain what problems the tool solves
   - Be clear and direct about the tool's purpose

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Return a JSON object with exactly two fields:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Inferred Tool Name",
  "description": "Brief description of tool capabilities and purpose"
}
```

# EXAMPLE OUTPUT
For a web scraping module:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Web Scraper",
  "description": "Extracts structured data from websites with advanced filtering and pagination support"
}
```

# IMPORTANT NOTES
- Do NOT include any explanations or additional text outside the JSON
- Focus on what the tool DOES, not how it works
- When in doubt, prioritize clarity and conciseness
